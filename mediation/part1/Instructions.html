        You are about to participate in a study on decision-making. Your earnings in this study will depend partly on
        your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The entire session and all interaction between you will take place through your mobile phones. Please do not talk
        or try to communicate with other participants during the session. If you have any questions, please raise your
        hand, and the experimenter will come to you to answer your question privately.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        To determine your final earnings, your payoffs will be converted to euros.
        The exchange rate of points to â‚¬ is XX euros for 1 point. You will be paid for your participation via bank transfer
        within two-three days after the session.
